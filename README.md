Minimalist status line generator for [i3](https://i3wm.org/) /
[sway](https://swaywm.org/) bar written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and configred
in [Yaml](https://yaml.org/).

In short, this is what [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) would
look like if I had written it.
This is also where the name comes from - a combination from `i3blocks` and `go`.

**Note:** this project was formely known as `kherson`, which however could be
considered cultural appropriation, so I decided to rename it.

## Installation and configuration

Refer to the according pages on the [project website](https://alexcoder04.github.io/i3gocks/).

## Contributing

I'm generally open for any kind of contributions, however I have a pretty
specific view on the design of this project, so fancy complex features probably
would not be accepted.

When in doubt, just open an [issue](https://github.com/alexcoder04/i3gocks/issues)
and we'll discuss your idea there.
