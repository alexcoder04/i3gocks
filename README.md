On 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine and is killing thousands of innocent
civilians. This has to stop! I named my new project after
[Kherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kherson), a city in the south of
Ukraine, to draw attention to this inacceptable issue.

# kherson

Minimalist status line generator for [i3](https://i3wm.org/) /
[sway](https://swaywm.org/) bar written in [Go](https://go.dev/).
**A work in progress**

## How it works

The main idea is similar to [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks): the
status line consists of blocks, every block shows the output of a command.
However, the config and some functionality is different. In short, this is
what i3blocks would look like I was had written it.
