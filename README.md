## Project naming

I wanted a creative name for my new project so the idea came to my mind to
choose a name which would send out a message to the world.
[Kherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kherson) is a city in the south of
Ukraine, I chose it to draw attention to Russia's war against Ukraine.

Minimalist status line generator for [i3](https://i3wm.org/)/[sway](https://swaywm.org/)
bar written in [Go](https://go.dev/). **A work in progress**

## How it works

The main idea is similar to [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks): the
status line consists of blocks, every block shows the output of a command.
However, the config and some functionality is different. In short, this is
what i3blocks would look like I was had written it.
