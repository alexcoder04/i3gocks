# General

Configuration is done in [yaml](https://yaml.org/), a human- and machine-friendly markup language.

The config file is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kherson/config.yml`

If the config does not exist or cannot be loaded, the minimal default hardcoded config is used.

# Config structure

```yml
Modules:
 - ...
 - ...
Colors:
 - ...
 - ...
```

# Modules

## Example with all fields (only Name and Command are mandatory):

```yml
 - Name: time
   ForegroundColor: "*green"   # default: "*white"
   BackgroundColor: "#111111"  # default: "*black"
   Pre: "‚è∞ "                  # default: ""
   Post: " "                   # default: ""
   Command: "date"
   Args: ["+%d.%m.%Y - %R:%S"] # default: []
   Interval: 1                 # default: 1
   Markup: "none"              # default: "none"
   Signal: 2                   # default: 0
```

## Pre

String added before the block text.

Possible values: any string.

## Post

```

Possible values: any executable on your system.

## Args

Command-line arguments that are passed to the command.

Possible values: any array of strings.

## Interval

Possible values: any positive integer.

## Markup

Possible values: `none` / `pango`

## Signal

Number of signal (`SIGRTMIN+n`) that can be sent to kherson to reload the block.

Possible values: `1`-`15`

# Colors

The colors array is optional, colors are loaded from these locations before (later locations override previous ones):

1. Hardcoded defaults (gruvbox dark theme).
2. Environment. Any environmental variable that starts with `COLOR_` is considered a color value. Example: `$COLOR_RED` is loaded as `RED`
3. Your config
